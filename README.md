# Table Tennis for VR - Play on Oculus Devices
This repository contains the code for a simple Virtual Reality Table Tennis game for a single player.

The code might not compile, as some files had to be left away to adhere to GitHub's size limit.
The complete code, a pre-built version for Oculus Rift as well as a demo video can be found by downloading [this archive](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/hYy3xaxMjihq6dQ). Below, you can also find a short gif showcasing the game.
